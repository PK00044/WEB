    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>These elements do not start on a new line and only take as much width as necessary</p>
    <h2>Block Elements</h2>
    <p>These elements start on a new line and take up the entire width of the container by default.They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves,pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.</p>

    Look p tag is inline element and anchor(a)tag is a bloack element here p bg-color takes whole width and "a" bg-color takes just the width of the words. <br> "div" tag is block element and "span" tag is a inline element
    <p>this is a paragrapgh</p>
