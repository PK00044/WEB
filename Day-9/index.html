    <h2>ID</h2>
        An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScripte manipulations.(Its like Aadhar number different for all). <b>It's used in css by adding prefix "#" ex:- #firstdiv</b>. It's also used in linking now see if we know the ID of some content on wekipedia and use it while searching #id then it will take us to that particular content everytime we the id while searching
    <h2>Class</h2>
        The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way,you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.(It's like Class of 2 person studying in 10th). <b>It's used in css by adding prefix "." ex:- .red</b>
